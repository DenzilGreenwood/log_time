# LTQG Project Status Summary

## 🎯 **Repository Cleanup Completed**

The LTQG repository has been successfully cleaned and organized to present a professional, academic-quality theoretical framework.

### ✅ **Completed Actions**

#### 📁 **Repository Organization**
- **13 development artifacts** moved to `archive/` directory
- **10 test files** organized in `tests/` directory  
- **3 Python cache directories** cleaned
- **1 temporary image file** removed
- Main directory now contains only essential project files

#### 📋 **Documentation Updates**
- **README.md**: Updated to clearly present LTQG as speculative theory
- **DISCLAIMER.md**: Created comprehensive academic disclaimer
- **CONTRIBUTING.md**: Updated to emphasize peer review focus
- Added prominent badges and warnings about theoretical nature

#### 🔬 **Academic Transparency Enhanced**
