# LTQG Development Archive

This directory contains development artifacts, status reports, and 
temporary files from the LTQG project development process.

These files document the development history but are not part of 
the main theoretical framework.

## Contents:
- Development status reports (*.md)
- Implementation completion markers
- Fix and update documentation
- Temporary development artifacts

## Note:
These files are preserved for development history but can be 
safely ignored for understanding the LTQG framework itself.
