# THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK DISCLAIMER

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT NOTICE ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Log-Time Quantum Gravity (LTQG) is a speculative theoretical framework that has not undergone formal peer review.**

### Academic Status

- **‚ùó NOT PEER REVIEWED**: This work has not been submitted to or accepted by any peer-reviewed physics journal
- **üß™ SPECULATIVE THEORY**: LTQG represents preliminary theoretical explorations and conjectures
- **üîç SEEKING VALIDATION**: All theoretical claims require rigorous academic scrutiny and validation
- **üìä COMPUTATIONAL MODELING**: The code provides mathematical implementations of proposed concepts, not proven physics

### Use of This Work

#### ‚úÖ **Appropriate Uses:**
- **Educational exploration** of theoretical physics concepts
- **Computational experimentation** with mathematical models
- **Academic discussion** and critical analysis
- **Inspiration** for related theoretical research
- **Learning** about quantum gravity approaches

#### ‚ùå **Inappropriate Uses:**
- **Citing as established physics** without proper disclaimers
- **Using in formal physics education** without noting speculative nature
- **Claiming experimental validation** of any predictions
- **Presenting as peer-reviewed research** in academic contexts
- **Making definitive claims** about quantum gravity based on this work

### Academic Responsibility

If you reference, discuss, or build upon this work, please:

1. **Include clear disclaimers** about its speculative nature
