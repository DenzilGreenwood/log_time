## üìù **Recording Script Templates**

### **Academic Conference Version (3-5 minutes)**

**Opening (0:00-0:30)**
> "This is the first interactive demonstration of Log-Time Quantum Gravity, 
> showing how œÉ-coordinates resolve black hole singularities through 
> asymptotic silence rather than finite-time crashes."

**œÉ-Additivity Demo (0:30-1:30)**
> "The key insight of LTQG is that gravitational time dilations add 
> logarithmically. Here we see D_A times D_B equals e to the sum of 
> their œÉ values, making time dilation additivity explicit."
>
> *[Adjust D_A and D_B sliders, highlight live calculations]*

**Instrument Panel (1:30-2:30)**
> "Real-time readouts show the œÑ-œÉ relationship, where proper time œÑ 
> equals œÑ‚ÇÄ times e^œÉ. As œÉ approaches negative infinity, we approach 
> the classical singularity, but in finite œÉ-steps."
>
> *[Adjust œÉ slider, show instrument updates]*

**Asymptotic Silence (2:30-3:30)**
> "The geodesic particle demonstrates asymptotic silence - motion slows 
> exponentially as we approach œÉ = -‚àû, preventing finite-time singularity 
> encounters. This is the core of LTQG singularity regularization."
>
> *[Play animation, show motion scaling]*

**Paradigm Comparison (3:30-4:30)**
> "Toggling between standard general relativity and LTQG views shows how 
> the logarithmic time transformation provides a fundamentally different 
> approach to quantum gravity, preserving unitarity through asymptotic behavior."
>
> *[Toggle standard view, highlight differences]*

**Conclusion (4:30-5:00)**
> "This interactive tool makes LTQG concepts accessible for education and 
> research, demonstrating how logarithmic time coordinates offer a novel 
> solution to quantum gravity's classical singularity problem."
