## Paper Created: LTQG_Problem_of_Time.tex

### Overview
Successfully created a comprehensive follow-up paper that specifically addresses the canonical "problem of time" in quantum gravity through the LTQG framework. This builds upon the main LTQG research paper with focused analysis on Wheeler-DeWitt formalism and canonical quantum gravity.

### Key Content Areas

- Detailed exposition of the temporal crisis in canonical quantum gravity
- Wheeler-DeWitt constraint and the "frozen formalism" problem
- Structural incompatibility between multiplicative GR time and additive QM evolution
- Critical review of existing approaches (Page-Wootters, Rovelli, Barbour, etc.)

#### 2. **LTQG Solution Framework** (Sections 3-4)
- σ-parametrized Wheeler-DeWitt equation: `iℏ ∂Ψ/∂σ = τ₀eᵈ Ĥ Ψ`
- Restoration of explicit temporal evolution to universal wavefunction
- Asymptotic silence mechanism providing natural boundary conditions
- Covariant path-integral formulation with exponential temporal measure

#### 3. **Quantum Gravity Program Integration** (Section 5)
- Detailed comparison with Loop Quantum Gravity, Causal Set Theory, Asymptotic Safety
- LTQG as temporal complement to geometric quantization approaches
- Comprehensive table showing relationships to major QG programs

#### 4. **Experimental Accessibility** (Section 6)
- Protocol-dependent predictions (σ-uniform vs τ-uniform)
- Specific experimental systems: LIGO, optical clocks, ion traps
- Distinguishability analysis showing >10¹¹σ sensitivity levels

#### 5. **Cosmological Applications** (Section 7)
- FLRW cosmology in σ-coordinates
- Big Bang regularization through asymptotic silence
- Quantum field theory in expanding universe with σ-parametrization
